## Smart Contracts

### Consultation Contract
- Manages consultation sessions between patients and doctors
- Handles payment processing and escrow
- Stores consultation records with privacy considerations
- Features:
  - Doctor registration and verification
  - Consultation scheduling
  - Secure medical notes storage (hashed)
  - Payment processing

## Development Setup

1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
npm install --global @stacks/cli
```

2. Clone Repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd telemedicine-platform
```

3. Run Tests:
```bash
clarinet test tests/consultation_test.ts
```

## Security Considerations

1. Patient Privacy
   - All medical data is stored as hashes
   - Access control mechanisms for patient records
   - Compliance with healthcare data regulations

2. Payment Security
   - Escrow system for consultation payments
   - Refund mechanisms for canceled sessions
   - Fee validation and minimum thresholds

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for complete consultation flow
- Property-based tests for edge cases
- Minimum 50% test coverage requirement
